Solution:

n and p+q are encrypted using Vigenere cipher, as hinted with the date 1963 which was the year it was first cracked. The shift key is the word UNCLE which is all in caps giving a conspicuous hint of sorts. Then m and p+q are decoded using the key and upon decryption, a hex is obtained. It is then converted to decimal and bit needs to be added to it to obtain the actual n and p+q. Now we have n=pq and p+q, using this we find p and q separately and the private key is constructed and the ciphertext is decrypted to obtain the flag.
