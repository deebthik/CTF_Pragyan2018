## Fast-Hardware

Alex loves computers. So he purchases a computer which was said to have the first model of Photoshop on it and was having a time. He found this incomplete text file with a clue attached to it:

0x619619610x961961960x196196190xabcdxxxx

0x5245ce54 0x41ea61f5 0x7f1115ee 0x9e8fd169
0xb46807fa 0xf1f1f344 0xe94454cb 0xe98dd78c
0x426092be 0x96e1de9f 0xb553dbb0 0x3e1d7cfe
0x7ecb6f98 0xa1f2f7c7 0xd788bd0c 0xdaf23a63

2 are numbers, 2 are unknown not more than 4 hours it takes you.

Alex, being a cryptography enthusiast, deduced that a part of the IV was missing in the clue. Can you find the missing 4 characters?
