Title: Ground Control - Major Tom

Stacy, an employee at NASA has encrypted the following message with an unknown key, with AES-128-CBC:

Original: Ground Control - Minor Bob

Encrypted: 114fa4e813e1157a776721d960547e21f1d333a493b34669be3b7bc36a4c15a3

She then realizes that she mistyped the message. The correct message to be typed was “Ground Control - Major Tom”. She has forgotten the key but the receiving end’s key is still intact, so all she has to do now is somehow figure out how to change the ciphertext so that when decrypted, its reads the correct message. Help her out.

Note: The flag is not in the usual format.
