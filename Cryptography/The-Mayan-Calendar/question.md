# The Mayan Calendar

The Mayan Calendar is an interesting piece of history, one subject to much speculation and as many would've heard of, Doomsday theories.

The Maya calendar system records a series of recurring cycles of time based on the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets. Any given date repeats at cyclic intervals and a complete Maya Long Count cycle is 5,125 years long.

There are two theories as to the start date of the Mayan Calendar: August 11, 3114 BC and August 13, 3114 BC

A basic format in which the dates are written is as follows:
baktun.katun.tun.uinal.k’in | Tzolk’in | Haab | Lord of the Night

An archaeologist unearths a plaque with the Mayan Calendar with a papyrus scroll on which is scribbled:
