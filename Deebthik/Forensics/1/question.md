INTO THE NEXT DIMENSION

Alice is stuck in a two-dimensional world and somehow needs to escape into reality, our three-dimensional world. In order to do so, she must crack a code hidden inside a file(named 'way_out.obj'). The only clues the two-dimensional Gods have given her is this:

clue_begin

1 - P(-50, -33, 77), R(90, 0, 0)
2 - P(123, -5, 68), R(60, 30, 0)
3 - P(-89, 90, 0), R(34, 23, 32)
4 - P(-39, 40, 40), R(44, 55, 66)
P(111, 222, 333)
5-10 - Ears, eyes, nose and mouth
11 - Inside the key

You will never find a way out without RGB

clue_end

Help Alice get back to reality and hence find the flag. Good luck (Y).
